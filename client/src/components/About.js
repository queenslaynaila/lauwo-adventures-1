              Lauwo Adventures is a local tour company operating in Kilimanjaro
              originating from the mountaineer family of &apos;Yohani Kinyala
              Lauwo&apos; who was the first African guide to climb and conquer
              the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro 5895M/19341Ft &apos;AMSL&apos; in
              1889 with Hans Mayer, a German geologist. As grandsons, we are
              committed to providing excellent and safe tours infused with
              vibrant local cultural experiences to our clients with
              professional and competent guides and porters.
              <br />
              <br />
              With more than a decade&apos;s experience in the Tanzanian tourism
              industry, we take pride in our unparalleled adventures. Our
              company has a porter support program through which we select and
              employ porters from local communities located at the foot of the
              mountain and provide them with scholarships and vocational
              training. This is to help combat poverty by supporting their
              dreams and goals.
